//String type
JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.

//Boolean type
Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false. See Boolean and Boolean for more details.

//Null type
The Null type has exactly one value: null. 

//Undefined type
A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.
//Number Type
The number type has only one integer with two representations positive & negative.
